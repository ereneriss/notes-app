# Notes Suite

A minimal, premium notes application focused on clarity, speed, and thoughtful writing.

Notes Suite is designed as a calm, distraction-free space for capturing and refining ideas — not as a complex productivity system.

- Title + body note structure

Every feature is added only if it improves focus and reduces friction.
